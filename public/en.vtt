00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
How is a 21st-century city governed?

00:04.000 --> 00:08.500
Analyzing, understanding, acting.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.500
Every citizen's opinion has a place on the map

00:11.500 --> 00:15.500
and every piece of data is transformed into an intelligent proposal for action.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.500
When you understand, you govern better

00:18.500 --> 00:20.500
and with better decisions, you improve your community.
