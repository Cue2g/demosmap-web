Would you like to know what your key audiences think?

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
Understanding the opinions of your target audiences is essential to achieving any goal.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
That’s why Demosmap was created—to help you gain those insights.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
With Demosmap, you can launch as many micro-surveys as you need,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
ensuring that each opinion gathered is truly representative.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
As you collect responses from your audiences of interest,

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
you can visualize them in real time, in a geolocated format.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Right on your map.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
and create personalized campaigns based on gender, location, or age.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Or even better—based on their preferences, interests, or the answers

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
